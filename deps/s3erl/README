--------------------------------------------------------

Author:  Andrew Birkett <andy@nobugs.org>

Version: 0.2
Date:    2007/12/29

What is it?
-----------

Amazon's S3 storage service is a "pay as you go" service for storing
files.  You can use it to serve web content, backup your files, etc.

This s3erl library provides easy access to S3 for erlang applications.

More info at: http://www.amazon.com/b?node=16427261

Requirements
------------

- OTP-R12B (released on 2007/12/05).  Required due to a bug in inets'
  handling of the HTTP 204 code [bug OTP-6982] which is heavily used by
  S3.  Get it at http://erlang.org/download.html

- An Amazon Web Services account - see http://www.amazonaws.com

Installation and test
---------------------

$ tar zxvf s3erl-0.2.tar.gz
$ cd s3erl-0.2
$ make
$ echo "code:add_pathz(\"$PWD/ebin\")." >> ~/.erlang

$ erl
1> s3test:run( "Your Access Key Id", "Your Secret Access Key", "A name for a bucket test").
2> q().

The test will execute the following steps

 - list all of your buckets
 - create the test bucket (the name is the 3rd argument)
 - create a new object in that bucket
 - list all the objects in that bucket
 - delete the object
 - delete the bucket.

S3 has a single namespace for buckets, so you need to choose a unique
bucket name for this test.
